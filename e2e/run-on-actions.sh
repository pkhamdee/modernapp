# Given a version, it first checks here that the environment serves it (e2e/check-serving.sh) and stops before
# dispatching anything if not; the job waits for it, checks again after the test and records a Deployment, as an
# automatic run does. The run is named `E2E <environment>[ <version>]` (e.g. `E2E qa 0.3.0-rc.1`), which is how
# sign-off finds it.
#
# The job runs on the cluster's own runner, the Actions Runner Controller scale set `eshop-e2e`
# (deploy/ci-runners, ADR 0008), which starts one runner pod for the job and removes it afterwards. This script
# only dispatches the workflow from main and follows the run; nothing is registered on this machine.
# Tests: e2e/run-on-actions.test.sh.
#
# Needs: gh (logged in, write access); for a version, kubectl pointed at the cluster and jq (the check here).
