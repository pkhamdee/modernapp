# Sign off a release candidate (docs/git-workflow.md, "Sign-off"; ADR 0008): the sign-off workflow
# (.github/workflows/sign-off.yml) runs it on a push to main that adds or changes a release's record releases/X.Y.Z.md,
# i.e. when a sign-off PR (scripts/sign-off-pr.sh) is merged. It is not meant to be run by hand.
#
#   scripts/sign-off.sh <before> <after>   # the push: main's commit before it and after it
#
# The record names the candidate (a line `Candidate: `vX.Y.Z-rc.N``); who signed off is whoever merged the PR that
# brought in <after>. A push that adds or changes no record does nothing.
# Refuses, changing nothing (and failing, so the workflow run shows it), unless:
#   - the push adds or changes exactly one record, which names a candidate of its version, tag vX.Y.Z-rc.N on origin
#     (annotated);
#   - a merged PR brought in <after> (its merger signs off);
#   - origin/main pins eshop-qa to exactly that candidate and apps-qa is not suspended (scripts/pin-release.sh qa);
#   - QA's latest Deployment of vX.Y.Z-rc.N (e2e.yml, scripts/deployment.sh) created since main last changed QA's
#     pin succeeded (scripts/lib/qa.sh): older ones tested an earlier deployment. That run checked of the cluster that
#     QA served the candidate before and after the test (e2e/check-serving.sh);
#   - every candidate image $IMAGE_REGISTRY/<service>:X.Y.Z-rc.N (.github/services.json) exists, and any X.Y.Z image
#     that already exists has the candidate's digest;
#   - tag vX.Y.Z is absent, or is this candidate's sign-off (same commit, made by this script).
# Then, in this order, each step skipped or updated when an earlier run already did it, so a failed sign-off is
# finished by re-running the workflow's job:
#   1. copies each candidate image to X.Y.Z by digest (crane copy; never rebuilt) and checks the digest;
#   2. tags vX.Y.Z (annotated) on the candidate's commit and pushes it; images first, so the tag never names
#      images that don't exist. The tag message names the merger and the PR;
#   3. publishes (or updates) the GitHub Release vX.Y.Z: the images with digests, the QA Deployment and run, who
#      signed off in which PR;
#   4. opens (or updates) the prod promotion PR: scripts/promotion-pr.sh prod X.Y.Z.
#
# Environment: REPO and IMAGE_REGISTRY (defaults: scripts/lib/repo.sh), SIGN_OFF_RUN_URL (the workflow run, linked in
# the Release and PR), SIGN_OFF_READ_TOKEN (a token for the checks, e.g. the workflow's own; default: gh's token).
# Needs a clean checkout of main with <before> and <after>, push access to origin, `gh` with a token that may create
# Releases and PRs, crane logged in to the registry with push access, and jq. scripts/tests/release-scripts.sh tests
# it with fake gh and crane against a throwaway origin.
