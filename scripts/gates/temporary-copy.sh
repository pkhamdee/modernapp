# The temporary copy of eShop (ADR 0007): the gate that starts it from a set of images, waits until every part is
# healthy and the demo data is seeded, and throws it away. CI runs it before any image is pushed; it runs the same
# way on this Mac. The copy itself is scripts/gates/temporary-copy/compose.yaml.
#
#   scripts/gates/temporary-copy.sh build   # build the four images from this checkout (temporary-copy/<svc>:local)
#   scripts/gates/temporary-copy.sh up      # start the copy and wait until it is ready: exit 0, or exit 1 and remove it
#   scripts/gates/temporary-copy.sh down    # stop it and throw its data away
#
# Images (default: the :local ones `build` makes): ESHOP_WEB_IMAGE, ESHOP_API_IMAGE, ESHOP_NODE_API_IMAGE,
#   THIRDPARTY_MOCK_IMAGE, e.g. ESHOP_API_IMAGE=docker.io/pkhamdee/eshop-api:main-93392bd.
# TEMPORARY_COPY_PORT             host port of the copy's gateway, on 127.0.0.1 (default 8090)
# TEMPORARY_COPY_TIMEOUT_SECONDS  how long `up` waits for every part to become healthy (default 180)
# TEMPORARY_COPY_REPORT_DIR       where `up` writes the copy's status and logs when it fails (default reports/temporary-copy)
# TEMPORARY_COPY_KEEP=1           `up` leaves a copy that failed running, to look into it (then run `down`)
# TEMPORARY_COPY_STAFF_USERNAME / _PASSWORD   the throwaway Staff account, and TEMPORARY_COPY_NODE_IMAGE the
#                                 readiness check's Node image (defaults: temporary-copy/defaults.env)
#
# Ready means: eshop-api, eshop-node-api, thirdparty-mock, eshop-web and the gateway answer their probes
# (PostgreSQL through eshop-api's readiness), and through the gateway the demo catalog and its photos are there, a
# Customer signs in by SMS code from the mock's inbox and the Staff account signs in (temporary-copy/ready.mjs).
# On this Mac, point Docker at Rancher Desktop first: DOCKER_HOST=unix://$HOME/.rd/docker.sock.
